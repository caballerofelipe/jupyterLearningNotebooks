# TensorFlow: Tensor, Operation and Variable

In this example we will see how these elements are connected:

* [Tensor](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor): 'Represents one of the outputs of an Operation.'.
* [Operation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Operation): 'Represents a graph node that performs computation on tensors.'
* [Variable](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Variable): 'A variable maintains state in the graph across calls to run().'

It shows different operations for each of the above elements.
