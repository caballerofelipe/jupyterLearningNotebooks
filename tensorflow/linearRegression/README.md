# A TensorFlow very (very...) simple Linear Regression model

This directory shows how to train a TensorFlow linear regression model to fit data. The idea behind this is to have a very, very, simple example on how it works. It allows the reader to understand the basics of how TensorFlow's low level API works.

Data is in a very simple format to avoid adding unnecesary complexity to the code. The data was generated using the Excel file called linear_regression_data.xlsx in the same directory as the notebook.

The process is as follows:
* Prepare Python to handle the model
* Prepare the data (and if wanted also checking it)
* Create the TensorFlow Graph
* Running the model
* Checking the results

# Directory contents
* TensorFlow_linearRegression_verySimpleModel.ipynb, a Jupyter notebook containing the code and an explanation.
* TensorFlow_linearRegression_verySimpleModel.py, the whole model but only code.
* linear_regression_data.xlsx, an Excel file to generate the used data. It's here because it's a simple, fun and easy way to do it.
